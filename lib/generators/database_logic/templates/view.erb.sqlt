create or replace view [DB].<%= @name %> as
    # add your SQL here
    # select * from [DB].table where...
    
    # Tip: you can also back views with read-only models, eg:
    
    # class YourModel < ApplicationRecord
    #   self.table_name = "<%= @name %>"
    #   
    #   def readonly?
    #     true
    #   end
    # end
    
    
    # this is useful for instance for reporting purpose where your view may also be used by external applications
